x--Find ways to reduce dimensionality

Check for algorithms that accept categorical data

Figure out how to create new features

x--drop Manager id and try 

Do analysis of 0s dataset to find max counts of each feature
and draw insights

check if hyperparameter tuning in NN can give better results

Things to try:-

x1. Target encodeing
2. WOE
x3. Catboost
x4. Hashing -- dont use as many categories may end up under same label
x5. k fold encoding
x6. Use H2O package algorithms which take categorical variables 
without any encoding 
7. research denoising autoencoder
8. enquire about embedding + NN
9. Hyperband parameter tuning
Use SMOTE undersampling and resampling
Check precision vs recall curve



During validation make a test dataset with new catogories and
check performance of target encoding so that we can evaluate
the performance in a realtime senario.

Think of all the challenges that the model can face in realtime
and test it, be aware and bring it to notice

Suggest various thresholds for various cases and priorities of the
company. If their priority is mainly security and dont mind some 
labour suggest high recall at the cost of high fpr. if the priority 
is reducing labour then suggest mid range recall and lower fpr
(yoden index)
